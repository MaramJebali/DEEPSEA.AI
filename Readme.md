🌟 Introduction

Oceans are the life support system of our planet.Today, marine ecosystems are collapsing under pressure from climate change, pollution, and overfishing.
DeepSea.AI is an applied Artificial Intelligence project designed to monitor, protect, and restore Tunisia’s marine biodiversity through state-of-the-art deep learning solutions.
This project was developed as part of the Artificial Intelligence Engineering program at ESPRIT School of Engineering, following a Challenge-Based Learning (CBL) methodology.
All resources (datasets, models, satellite imagery) were used strictly for educational and research purposes.

🌟 Project Objectives

🦢 Track biodiversity changes at micro and macro scales.
🍣 Optimize aquaculture management with AI-based monitoring.
🛰️ Surveil marine activities with computer vision and satellite analysis.
🔊 Assess underwater noise pollution impacts.
🤖 Provide AI-powered assistance for marine researchers.

🚀 Key Features

11 validated deep learning models targeting real marine conservation challenges.
Marine Biodiversity Monitoring:Zooplankton Identification, Microalgae Detection, Coral Reef Health Classification.
Aquaculture Optimization:Fish Disease Detection, Fish Counting, Behavior Anomaly Detection.
Marine Surveillance:Vessel Detection from Satellite, Intruder Detection, Fish Catch Monitoring, Fish Size Estimation.
Assistive AI Systems:Marine Biodiversity Chatbot, Acoustic Noise Risk Reporting (NoiseShield AI).

🛠 Technologies
