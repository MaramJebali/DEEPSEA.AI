# 🌟 Introduction

Oceans are the life support system of our planet.  
Today, marine ecosystems are collapsing under pressure from climate change, pollution, and overfishing.

**DeepSea.AI** is an applied Artificial Intelligence project designed to **monitor**, **protect**, and **restore** Tunisia’s marine biodiversity through **state-of-the-art deep learning solutions**.

This project was developed as part of the Artificial Intelligence Engineering program at **ESPRIT School of Engineering**, following a **Challenge-Based Learning (CBL)** methodology.

All resources (datasets, models, satellite imagery) were used **strictly for educational and research purposes**.
