# ðŸŽ§ NoiseShield AI â€” DeepSea.AI

In the notebook we did builds a multimodal acoustic risk analysis tool for marine environments,  
combining **CNN sound classification** with **LLM-based scientific report generation**.

**Features:**
- Detects marine acoustic events (e.g., sonar, ship engines, cetacean clicks).
- Classifies top 5 acoustic events in recordings using PANNs CNN14.
- Automatically generates formal scientific risk reports with Mistral LLM.

**Technologies Used:**
- PANNs CNN14 Sound Classifier
- Librosa (audio processing)
- Mistral LLM for report generation

**Purpose:**
Provide rapid risk assessments for marine noise pollution monitoring projects,  
supporting sustainable marine management and conservation efforts.
