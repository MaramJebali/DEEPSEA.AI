# ðŸ§« Zooplankton Identification Model â€” DeepSea.AI


In the notebook we did fine-tunes a deep convolutional model to classify microscopic zooplankton species,  
crucial indicators of marine ecosystem health and climate changes.

**Features:**
- Fine-tuned **DenseNet121** model.
- 10 selected classes of marine zooplankton.
- Achieved 93% validation accuracy.

**Technologies Used:**
- TensorFlow / Keras
- DenseNet121 Pretrained Model
- Image Augmentation and Feature Extraction

**Purpose:**
Support biodiversity monitoring programs by automating the identification of zooplankton populations,  
essential for tracking ecological shifts and detecting early environmental stress.
