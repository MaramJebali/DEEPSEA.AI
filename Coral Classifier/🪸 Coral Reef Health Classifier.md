# ðŸª¸ Coral Reef Health Classifier â€” DeepSea.AI

This notebook trains and validates a deep learning model to classify coral reef images  
as **Healthy** or **Bleached**, to anticipate reef degradation due to climate change.

**Features:**
- Fine-tuned **EfficientNetV2-B0** model.
- Augmented marine datasets for robust generalization.
- Achieved validation accuracy over 80.32%.

**Technologies Used:**
- TensorFlow / Keras
- EfficientNetV2 Pretrained Model
- Data Augmentation with ImageDataGenerator

**Purpose:**
Provide conservationists with an early-warning tool to monitor reef health,  
enabling faster and better-targeted intervention strategies.
